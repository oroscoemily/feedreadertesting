# Feed Reader Testing: Project 4 by Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree
## Student: Emily Orosco Nu√±ez



## Project Description


In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

Use Jasmine to write a number of tests against the pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation. All tests must be independent of each other.

## Application Instructions

To see the test specs, access the index.html file via download from GitHub or clone the repository.
